# 🐍 Python Training Practice

Welcome to my Python Training repository! This repo contains all the exercises and solutions I practiced during a 21-day Python learning journey. It covers foundational programming skills with a focus on **number logic**, **arrays**, and **pattern printing**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `number_logics/` – Programs involving numeric logic (e.g., palindrome, Armstrong number, factorial, etc.)
- `arrays/` – Practice problems related to arrays/lists such as sorting, searching, and manipulation
- `patterns/` – Creative pattern printing using loops (stars, numbers, pyramids, etc.)
